# Arithmetic Expression Evaluation Project

## Overview
This project is an implementation of an Arithmetic Expression Evaluation program. The main goal was to apply data structure concepts, specifically stacks, to solve the problem of evaluating complex mathematical expressions. The program was initially designed to handle one-digit numbers, but enhancements were made to support multi-digit numbers, negative numbers, and parentheses.

## Key Features
- **Use of Stack Data Structure**: The project effectively utilizes the stack data structure to manage operators and operands during the expression parsing and evaluation process.
- **Multi-Digit Number Handling**: Extended the program to recognize and handle multi-digit numbers, allowing it to evaluate more complex expressions.
- **Support for Negative Numbers**: Implemented logic to manage negative numbers within expressions, ensuring correct parsing and calculation.
- **Handling of Parentheses**: Added support to evaluate expressions with nested parentheses, providing a comprehensive solution that follows the correct order of operations.

## Problem-Solving Approach
The project emphasizes practical problem-solving skills, showcasing the application of fundamental data structure techniques. By tackling the challenges of expression parsing and operation handling, this project demonstrates the effective use of stacks to manage and evaluate complex expressions.

## Conclusion
This project is a clear demonstration of how data structures can be applied in real-world scenarios. It showcases the use of stacks to evaluate arithmetic expressions, highlighting problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt code to handle more advanced cases such as multi-digit numbers, negative values, and nested parentheses.
